I previously worked in a pub and as a DJ up until around a year ago when I decided to open a studio.
Music has always been a passion for me so to work with talented people was like a dream come true.
I have always had a hand in it as far a djing or producing but to be able to actually help create it is beyond my wildest dreams.
